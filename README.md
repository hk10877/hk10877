## Hi I'm Harshita 👋

I'm a Computer Science major at UT Austin with a strong focus on software engineering, AI/ML, and data science. I have hands-on experience with Python, Java, C++, C, JavaScript, R, and SQL. I'm driven by problem-solving, collaboration, and building software that makes a real impact.
I'm always eager to learn, grow, and take on new challenges!
