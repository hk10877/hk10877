## Hi I'm Harshita 👋

I'm a Computational Biology major at UT Austin with a strong focus on AI/ML, data science, and software engineering. I have hands-on experience with Python, C++, Java, JavaScript, R, and SQL. I'm driven by problem-solving, collaboration, and building software that makes a real impact.
I'm always eager to learn, grow, and take on new challenges!

# 🎯 Featured Project: [SmartGrip](https://github.com/hk10877/SmartGrip)

**What We Did:**  
- Developed a prototype of an intelligent exercise bar utilizing AI and machine learning to enhance gym training.  
- Trained an XGBoost model using sensor data to provide performance insights and identify the type of exercise.  
- Designed and developed an app prototype to track and display user progress.
**Tools:** Python, scikit-learn, Figma  
**Result:** Won 3rd Place in the Women in Computer Science Hackathon at the University of Texas at Austin
