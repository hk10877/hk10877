## Hi I'm Harshita ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Computational Biology major at UT Austin with a strong focus on AI/ML, data science, and software engineering. I have hands-on experience with Python, C++, Java, JavaScript, R, and SQL. I'm driven by problem-solving, collaboration, and building software that makes a real impact.
I'm always eager to learn, grow, and take on new challenges!

# ðŸŽ¯ Featured Project: [SmartGrip](https://github.com/hk10877/SmartGrip)

**What We Did:**  
- Developed a prototype of an intelligent exercise bar utilizing AI and machine learning to enhance gym training.  
- Trained an XGBoost model using sensor data to provide performance insights and identify the type of exercise.  
- Designed and developed an app prototype to track and display user progress.

**Tools:** Python, scikit-learn, Figma  
**Result:** Won 3rd Place in the Women in Computer Science Hackathon at the University of Texas at Austin

# ðŸš€ Projects:
A few other projects Iâ€™ve worked on:

[PCR Robot - Automated Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) System](https://github.com/ECLAIR-Robotics/PCR_Automation)
Worked with a team to develop a robot capable of performing Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR). Designed and implemented machine learning and computer vision algorithms to measure distances, calibrate robotic movements, and ensure precise execution of the PCR process.
Tech Stack: OpenCV, NumPy, SciPy
Learnings: Applied computer vision techniques for real-time robotic calibration and control.

[Auditorium - Seat Reservation System and Recommender](https://github.com/hk10877/AuditoriumCplusplus)
Developed a C++ program using linked lists to manage multiple auditoriums, handle seat reservations, and track orders with unique customer logins. Features include the ability to reserve, modify, and cancel orders, as well as recommend the best available seats based on proximity and availability.
Tech Stack: C++
Learnings: Applied data structures (linked lists) and object-oriented programming principles to build a scalable, interactive system.
