## Hi I'm Harshita ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Computational Biology major at UT Austin with a strong focus on AI/ML, data science, and software engineering. I have hands-on experience with Python, C++, Java, JavaScript, R, and SQL. I'm driven by problem-solving, collaboration, and building software that makes a real impact.
I'm always eager to learn, grow, and take on new challenges!
